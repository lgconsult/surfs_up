# Overview
The purpose of our analysis is to assess weather data in a proposed location for an icecream/surf shop. Investors want to know more about the weather in the area so that they can assess whether the idea is a good investment.

## Results 
![June Temps](https://github.com/lgconsult/surfs_up/blob/main/june_temps.png)
![December Temps](https://github.com/lgconsult/surfs_up/blob/main/dec_temps.png)

- The temperature variation between June and December is only 4 degrees when comparing average temperature, indicating that seasonal weather should not effect business. 
- The minimum temperature between June and December is much greater, in December the minimum is 56 while in June it is 64. This could effect the business of an icecream/suf shop
- The maximum temperature is only off by two degrees from June and December, indicating December still gets relatively warm.

## Summary
While the average temperature and highs for June and December are comparable there is a significant difference in the minimum temperature. I would suggest checking two additional details to further strengthen our business case for an icecream/surf shop here. The first is I would look at precipitation data, I would assume that there is more rain in December, leading to a lower temperature, but would want to confirm. I would also want to check the time stamps for these data points and determine temperature variability throughout the day. This could help us plan the best hours to have the shop open, and when it might not be worth our time.
